Theswing does not work out in previous experiments. Possible reasons:
- The buggy constraint controller (switch to the pid position control)
- Power (solved but untested)
- Moment of inertia of the legs (maybe later)
- control frequency (300 Hz current). This should not be a issue.


The swing motion frequency is about 1.25Hz. The Arduino controller should be totally fine.

3) Shall we use longer rod? Maybe not,

Schedule:
1) speed controller is maybe not the issue. Go with it first and reduce control frequency. Controll frequency can be issue. To reduce the controll frequency to 20Hz.
2) If this does not work out, try position controller
3) If this does not work out, try to fix the speed controller
